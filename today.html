      <p>Deep Underground, a Chinese Miner Discovered Poetry in the Toil</p>
      <p>Chen Nianxi has risen to fame as a &ldquo;migrant worker poet,&rdquo; adding the voice of China&rsquo;s often-invisible laborers to the cultural conversation.</p>

      <p>Anhedonia</p>
      <p><span style="color: #2e2e2f;">The clinical term</span><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anhedonia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>anhedonia</em></a><span style="color: #2e2e2f;">describes an absence of pleasure felt in the presence of something that normally gives you pleasure. The word combines the negative prefix</span><span style="color: #2e2e2f;"><em>an-</em></span><span style="color: #2e2e2f;">with the Greek root</span><span style="color: #2e2e2f;"><em>hēdonē</em></span><span style="color: #2e2e2f;">, meaning &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; (as found in</span><span style="color: #2e2e2f;"><em>hedonism</em></span><span style="color: #2e2e2f;">).</span></p>
      <p style="color: #273137;">Yoga, for Dederer, started out as an attempt to fix something that was wrong: not just searing back pain, but her tremor, her anxiety, her<em>anhedonia</em>, her judgemental nature, her marriage.</p>

      <p>Leucocholy</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/leucocholy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Leucocholy</em></a><span style="color: #2e2e2f;">is defined as &ldquo;a state of feeling that accompanies preoccupation with trivial and insipid diversions.&rdquo; (Seeking distraction on the internet would seem to meet this description.)</span></p>
      <p style="color: #2e2e2f;">The word is attributed by many to the 18th century poet Thomas Gray, who created the nonce word by replacing the first half of<em>melancholy</em>(<em>melan-</em>, meaning &ldquo;black&rdquo; or &ldquo;dark&rdquo;) with the New Latin spelling of the Greek<em>leuko</em>, meaning &ldquo;light.&rdquo; In a 1742 letter, Gray writes of &ldquo;white Melancholy, or rather<em>Leucocholy</em>, for the most part; which though it seldom laughs or dances, nor ever amounts to what one calls Joy or Pleasure, yet is a good easy sort of state, and<em>&ccedil;a ne laisse que de s&rsquo;amuser</em>.&rdquo;</p>

      <p style="color: #2f2f2f;">He Cared About Me, So I Broke Up With Him</p>
      <p style="color: #2f2f2f;">A month after that, he dropped me at a music studio where I curled up on a leather sofa with my dear friend Nataly&rsquo;s dog and &ldquo;A Room of One&rsquo;s Own&rdquo; and listened to her band, Pomplamoose, record an album. I had massaged my temple in the car, and he noticed. I said that I was out of ibuprofen, but it was just a little headache. When he picked me up, a bottle of water and a packet of Motrin waited on my seat.</p>
      <p style="color: #2f2f2f;">And so, four months after we met, I broke up with him. He was standing outside a movie theater, wearing his cardigan, backpack and boat shoes, and I couldn&rsquo;t take it a minute longer. His earnest love had become repulsive. Imagining the way he wanted to care for me &mdash; the inevitable loyalty and acceptance and protection &mdash; filled my throat with bile.</p>
      <p style="color: #2f2f2f;">David is handsome and hilarious. Every new thing I learned about him impressed me more &mdash; his adamant humility belied his intellect and confidence. Kissing him felt natural and our conversations were easy.</p>
      <p style="color: #2f2f2f;">Nevertheless, I broke it off.</p>

      <p>Could you take a day off from work to take a long weekend to visit one of your far-flung friends or family? Why not throw some clothes and a book you&rsquo;ve been meaning to read in a bag and hop a train to see a friendly face? You need a change of scene and to be in a room with someone who loves you. Combine the &ldquo;celebration of milestone&rdquo; with &ldquo;short break&rdquo; and &ldquo;refilling your friendship well.&rdquo; And don&rsquo;t gently hint at it &ndash;ask/tell. &ldquo;Old Friend, I would love to see your face this weekend. If I make it into town for a day or two can we meet up for brunch or dinner?&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, I want someone to celebrate this big work deal with. If I hop the train this Friday, can we meet up for a drink?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s okay to flash the &ldquo;Hey, I need you!&rdquo; symbol in the sky. If travel doesn&rsquo;t work, institute a Skype date or a long gossipy phone call. Email isn&rsquo;t working, social media isn&rsquo;t working, gently holding back isn&rsquo;t working, and you&rsquo;ve been trying so hard not to impose on anyone that you&rsquo;ve started to disappear. It&rsquo;s okay to say, &ldquo;Friend, I&rsquo;m a little lonely right now and I need you.&rdquo; Vulnerability connects us as much if not more than celebrating achievements. You&rsquo;re allowed to want that and ask for it.</p>
      <p>These are three pieces about nurturing friendships among adults that I really like:</p>

(You might cry when you read this). I have a group of far-flung friends who make the effort to get together in one place at least once a year, and it is the best. If you can&rsquo;t visit a friend now, can you try to plan a trip with a few people?</p>

To implement: Pick a day, gather your three local friends together at your place, and feed them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m celebrating finishing [MILESTONE], please come join me.&ldquo;If you enjoy it, try doing it once a month. Every now and then invite someone new and get to know them better.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;This is the downside of living in a gigantic country like the U.S.: You move away for college, you move away for work, you move away because you meet a great guy or girl, and one day you wake up and you&rsquo;re 2,000 miles away from anyone who knows you really well. For someone who&rsquo;s faintly allergic to small talk, who can never quite hit that lowest common denominator of casual chattiness, who can never quite manage to burble happily about the weather and the news and those cute shoes and the new restaurant down the block, making brand-new friends sounds about as appealing as a trip to the podiatrist.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>As with every question that touches on responsiveness to communications, chronic lateness, and relationships between planners and non-planners on the site, I think the issue is about a balancing act between&nbsp;affection&nbsp;andcompatibility.Sometimes all the affection in the world isn&rsquo;t enough to make a relationship work, and sometimes the answer is &ldquo;<a href="https://captainawkward.com/2021/04/27/1327-my-best-friends-other-best-friend-is-the-worst-how-do-i-free-myself-without-losing-my-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wait,&nbsp; back up, do you even&nbsp;like&nbsp;these people?</a>&rdquo;</p>
      <p>It is okay to want friends who are compatible with you and who meet your needs without you having to coax them into it. For readers whose first thought is&ldquo;COME THE EFF ON, how hard is it to text back????!!!!!!???????,&rdquo;please know I think that it is perfectly okay to decide to not be friends with people who continually infuriate you.&ldquo;I could never be friends with someone who __________[expects immediate responses][takes a while to respond].&rdquo;COOL, DON&rsquo;T BE. A lot of failures of &ldquo;manners&rdquo; and reciprocity in friendships that I see in letters are really mismatches in affection, and being honest about that would set everyone free.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I feel like there was something I wanted to communicate about the seemingly illusory nature of human identity, the criteria we use to decide when someone no longer gets our empathy, how little we actually know about each other, especially online,&rdquo; she wrote in a follow-up email. In those questions about identity, both real and invented, &ldquo;how strange it is to wrap all that in capital and &lsquo;making a living.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

      <p style="color: #333333;">It has done so not only because of the violence that was visited upon an enclave of proud homes just north of Cannes, or because the protagonists were from diametrically opposed backgrounds. There was also the enigma of the locked room that was never satisfactorily unraveled. And there was the final message &mdash; which contained a grammatical error.</p>
      <p style="color: #333333;">&ldquo;Omar killed me,&rdquo; Ms. Marchal appeared to have written in her dying moments. Or, in the original French, &ldquo;Omar m&rsquo;a tuer&rdquo; &mdash; not &ldquo;m&rsquo;a tu&eacute;e,&rdquo; as it should have been. The mistake raised very French questions about class and language, primarily whether a woman of her station would make such a trivial error or if instead the gardener was being framed and was easily convicted because he was of Arab descent.</p>

      <p style="color: #2f2f2f;"><strong><em>You write that debutantes were necessary &mdash;&nbsp;were, in effect, manufactured &mdash; to &ldquo;solve a problem.&rdquo; What was that problem in post-Reformation Europe, how did it shift over the centuries to come, and what, broadly defined, is the problem that they solve today?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
      <p style="color: #2f2f2f;">So, yes! The original problem the Reformation created was a glut of daughters. Fathers had always married off their daughters to the best possible suitors to keep their wealth as concentrated as possible and to create powerful strategic alliances. Until the Reformation, many rich European families would invest all their money in their &ldquo;best&rdquo; daughter and send the daughters they deemed less valuable to convents to avoid having to dilute their fortunes by providing each one with a dowry. The family would pay a nominal fee for the daughter to live in respectable seclusion, which some young women preferred given that they were not choosing their husbands.</p>
      <p style="color: #2f2f2f;">When Henry VIII separated from Rome and dissolved all the Catholic institutions in England, these fathers were no longer able to cloister their unmarriageable girls and had to find ways to pair them off. Because marriage was the only remaining respectable path for women, a daughter&rsquo;s failure to marry could embarrass her family and keeping her at home was more expensive than the convent. So, by the time Mr. Bennet throws up his hands in exhaustion about &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to be done with all these girls?&rdquo; in the early pages of<em>Pride and Prejudice,</em>the daughter problem had already been brewing for several hundred years.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The industry is delighted to frame the debate around either this emerging privacy approach or its existing contract permission strategy. Both let you say no and be (more or less) forgotten. With forethought and effort, you may be able to cut yourself out from the databases. But excluding one DNA profile, or even ten thousand, is largely costless to the industry so long as it controls the real prize, the millions-strong databases of people who did not realize the stakes in deciding whether to check &ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>More Women Than Men Are Going to College. That May Change the Economy.</p>
      <p>The rising gender gap in college education &mdash; currently three women for every two men &mdash; might turn out to be one of the most transformative trends of our time.</p>

      <p>The numbers alone are staggering. One in 500 children in the US has lost a parent or caregiver to Covid, according to<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p1007-covid-19-orphaned-children.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study</a>published last month. One in every four Covid deaths leaves yet another bereaved child behind.</p>
      <p>The deaths are not evenly distributed. American Indian or Alaskan Native children are 4.5 times more likely than white children to have lost a caregiver, Black children 2.4 times more likely, and Hispanic children nearly twice as likely, per the CDC study. That means that without support, Native, Black, and Hispanic communities are likely to bear the brunt of the long-term effects of childhood bereavement, from depression to problems at school, as well.</p>
      <p>No crisis in recent memory has produced this much loss in such a short period. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t really had an experience of mass bereavement here in the US in the same sense,&rdquo; Kidman said. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re not done.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Not all deaths are created equal. In February 2020, the world began to panic about the novel coronavirus, which killed 2714 people that month. This made the news. In the same month, around 800,000 people died from the effects of air pollution. That didn&rsquo;t. Novelty counts for a lot. At the start of the pandemic, it was considered unseemly to make comparisons like these. But comparing the value of human lives is one thing the machine of modern civilisation does relentlessly, almost invariably to prioritise and absolve the rich &ndash; when, for example, the global supply of Covid vaccines is apportioned primarily to the highest-income countries, or when the cost of natural disasters in Bangladesh is measured against the impact of sea-level rise on Miami Beach real estate, or when Joe Biden&rsquo;s onetime economic adviser Lawrence Summers proposed that Africa, as a whole, was &lsquo;vastly underpolluted&rsquo;, and suggested that &lsquo;the economic logic behind dumping a whole load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>When the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/health/death-rates-rising-for-middle-aged-white-americans-study-finds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first</a>published their research on &ldquo;deaths of despair&rdquo; five years ago, they focused on middle-aged whites. So many white working-class Americans in their 40s and 50s were dying of suicide, alcoholism and drug abuse that the overall mortality rate for the age group was no longer falling &ndash; a rare and shocking pattern in a modern society.</p>
      <p>But as Case and Deaton continued digging into the data, it became clear that the grim trends didn&rsquo;t apply only to middle-aged whites. Up and down the age spectrum, deaths of despair have been surging for people without a four-year college degree:</p>

      <p>difference-between-access-point-and-router</p>
      <p><span style="color: #2e2e2f;"><strong>What is a Router?</strong></span>&nbsp;A router is a network device that serves two primary functions: (1) it connects multiple computers, phones, tablets, or other devices to form a managed local area network, and (2) it provides Internet access to all of the compatible devices that are connected to the router.</p>
      <p>A local area network (LAN) can be set up by simply deploying a router and connecting one or several devices to it. Modern routers allow users to connect devices both via Ethernet cables or wirelessly (using Wi-Fi).</p>
      <p>However, in order for the router to distribute and deliver data to the devices within the local area network, it must be connected to an Internet service provider&rsquo;s customer premises equipment (CPE) via an Ethernet cable.</p>
      <p><span style="color: #2e2e2f;"><strong>What is an Access Point?</strong></span>&nbsp;An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ligowave.com/products/nft-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access point</a>&nbsp;is a wireless network device that acts as a portal for devices to connect to a local area network. Access points are used for extending the wireless coverage of an existing network and for increasing the number of users that can connect to it.</p>
      <p>A high-speed Ethernet cable runs from a router to an access point, which transforms the wired signal into a wireless one. Wireless connectivity is typically the only available option for access points, establishing links with end-devices using Wi-Fi.</p>
      <p><span style="color: #2e2e2f;"><strong>Main Differences.</strong></span>&nbsp;The router acts as a hub that sets up a local area network and manages all of the devices and communication in it. An access point, on the other hand, is a sub-device within the local area network that provides another location for devices to connect from and enables more devices to be on the network.</p>
      <p>Wireless routers can function as access points, but not all access points can work as routers. While routers manage local area networks, communicate with outside network systems, acquire, distribute, and dispatch data in multiple directions, establish a point of connectivity, and ensure security, access points typically only provide access to the router&rsquo;s established network.</p>

      <p>testimony (n.)</p>
      <p>c. 1400, "proof or demonstration of some fact, evidence, piece of evidence;" early 15c., "legal testimony, sworn statement of a witness," from Old North Frenchtestimonie&nbsp;(Old Frenchtestimoine&nbsp;11c.), from Latintestimonium&nbsp;"evidence, proof, witness, attestation," fromtestis&nbsp;"a witness, one who attests" (see<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/testament?ref=etymonline_crossreference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testament</a>) +-monium, suffix signifying action, state, condition. Despite the common modern assertion, the sense of the word is unlikely to have anything to do withtesticles&nbsp;(see<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/testis?ref=etymonline_crossreference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testis</a>).</p>
      <p>Earliest attested sense in English is "the Ten Commandments" (late 14c.), from Vulgate use of Late Latintestimonium, along with Greekto martyrion&nbsp;(Septuagint), translations of Hebrew'eduth&nbsp;"attestation, testimony" (of the Decalogue), from'ed&nbsp;"witness."</p>

      <p>When wrestling with a first draft, take off the pressure by remembering that ultimately all our efforts are absolutely meaningless at a cosmic scale so we may as well lie on the floor and stare at the sky until the soil reclaims us. Also, you can make it less shit in a 2nd draft.</p>

      <p>Phineas P.

      <p>Long known as the "American Crowbar Case"&zwj;&mdash;&zwnj;once termed "the case which more than all others is cal&shy;cu&shy;lated to excite our wonder, impair the value of<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Prognosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prognosis</a>, and even to subvert our<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Physiology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phys&shy;i&shy;o&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal</a>doctrines"<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Phineas_Gage#citenotecampbell3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a>&zwj;&mdash;&zwnj;Phineas Gage influenced 19th-century discussion about the mind and brain, par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly debate on<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cerebral_localization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cerebral local&shy;i&shy;za&shy;tion</a>,<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Phineas_Gage#M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[M]</a>: ch7-9<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Phineas_Gage#B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[B]</a>and was perhaps the first case to suggest the brain's role in deter&shy;min&shy;ing per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ity, and that damage to specific parts of the brain might induce specific mental changes.</p>

      <p>Young or middle-aged people who come to us from the medical examiner often look the most like themselves after embalming, but sometimes those differences are especially marked and heartbreaking. A young woman who hanged herself, leaving her face swollen and discolored. The family gave us a photo of a laughing woman with clear skin and freckles. Those freckles were lost under the thick foundation we used to cover her purple cheeks. I was an art student once; I was not artist enough to give this woman back her laugh. Others who die violently or by trauma may be as much wax as flesh by the time they&rsquo;re viewed. We spend hours rebuilding their faces, even days. The results can be remarkable, but in the end, just an effigy.</p>

      <p style="color: #2f2f2f;">My corner of the underworld is also short-staffed right now. (During a pandemic?<em>&nbsp;Quelle surprise!)</em>And not just us, but many of our third-party psychopomp services as well. But hospitals need those beds. Families would prefer not to leave their loved ones lying on the floor. Bodies in those refrigerated trucks need to be embalmed as soon as possible. So we pick up the overtime, and maybe cry in the cooler a little. That&rsquo;s just back of house&ndash;the directors are also stressed and overworked, but I don&rsquo;t know where they go to cry. Maybe the casket selection room.</p>
      <p style="color: #2f2f2f;">People have many different opinions when it comes to deathcare, but I suspect most everyone accepts that it&rsquo;s necessary. For me, the part where necessity, ethics, and good intentions sink like Artax in the Swamp of Sadness is the intersection of death and capitalism.</p>
